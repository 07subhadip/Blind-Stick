# Blind Stick

Blind Stick is a project that includes a variety of components. Below are details about one of its main components, TFMINI with Arduino.

## TFMINI with Arduino

TFMINI is a sensor often used in projects like Blind Stick. Here's how to connect TFMINI with Arduino UNO R3:

1. **TX (Data Out) - PIN 2 (Green):** Connect the green wire from TFMINI to PIN 2 on Arduino.
2. **RX (Data In) - PIN 1 (White):** Connect the white wire from TFMINI to PIN 1 on Arduino.
3. **GND (Ground) - Black:** Connect the black wire from TFMINI to the ground (GND) on Arduino.
4. **VCC (Power) - Red:** Connect the red wire from TFMINI to the 5V power source on Arduino.

This configuration establishes communication between the TFMINI Lidar sensor and the Arduino UNO R3.
